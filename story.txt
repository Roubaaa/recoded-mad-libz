It is a scary[a] Halloween night. I have my ghost[n] costume on and I step outside to begin my adventurous[a] evening of trick or treating.
I walked[v] down the street and rang[v] up to the first door. " trick[n] or treat" I said as the door began to open. " trick[n] or treat?" a woman[n] said on the
other side of the door. "What does that mean?" "It means if you don't give me a treat I'll have to trick[v] you." she said as she agressively[a] closed[v]
out the door and I walked[v] down the street. I only wanted a candy[n]!
